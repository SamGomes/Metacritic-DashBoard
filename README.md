This work consists in a dashboard reguarding information of the Metacritic website. It was exported to Git because it was developed externally.

To open our visualization just open "code/layout/layout.html" in a web browser.

To better experience our visualization use a Firefox Browser, with a window of 1920x1080 (Full HD) and a zoom of 100%.
